# Hello there, I am Sami!
a pre-final year CSE undergrad who loves to **craft web experiences**. Always ready to take up challenges to **make the internet a little better than before**.

I usually try new things and break here and make at [**@sm-sami**](https://github.com/sm-sami). I do all things web, but I mostly spend time building user interfaces.

My primary tech stack is **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, **TypeScript** for frontend and **Node.js**, **Express** and **MongoDB/PostgreSQL** and *yet again* **TypeScript** for backend. I also dabble with **Arduino** here and there! I am currently learning Rust and Remix.

### My Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Rust
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Svelte, and Remix
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Firebase
- **Tools**: Git, Postman, Vercel
- **UI/UX**: Figma, Adobe XD, and Affinity Designer

- [**Guess the Place Bot**](https://github.com/sm-sami/mlu-bot) <br /> A discord bot for organizing Guess the Place and more. Built with discord.js and TypeScript.
- [**ScoreBoard**](https://github.com/sm-sami/ScoreBoard) <br /> A place to keep track of your scores. Built with Svelte.
